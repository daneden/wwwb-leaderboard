# ⚠️ This Repository Has Been Archived
The code that displays the Who Would Win Bot leaderboard has been centralised along with the same code that creates fights, tracks data, and tallies results.

You can find the unified repository at [daneden/who-would-win-bot](https://github.com/daneden/who-would-win-bot)
